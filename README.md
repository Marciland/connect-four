# vier-gewinnt | connect four

I created this game based on a request made from my school.

Small challenge for myself: only use build in... lets see that tkinter lol

Therefore this is not maintained by any means and might not run as expected.

## How to run

> python main.py

quite simple right?

There are no dependencies. Tested this on python 3.10.

## Contributors
