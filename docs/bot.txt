There are 4 difficulties.

0 = Easy
Easy just throws random coins without any logic or reasoning.
This should always loose to the player.

1 = Medium
Medium will stop the player from winning.
This should always result in a draw.

2 = Hard
Hard will look for opportunities to win while preventing the player's win.
This should result in a win for the bot or a draw.

3 = Extreme
Extreme acts like hard, but will make safer moves by checking if a move would help the player win.

Btw the bot is still stupid as this is not calculating any moves ahead.
Placing in the middle is still a viable strategy against it.
